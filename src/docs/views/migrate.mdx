# Migration Guide

## v0.3 → v0.4

### `options.maxResultItems`

`maxResultItems` has been renamed. Please change occurrences of `maxResultItems` to `limit` in your code.

```diff
const fzf = new Fzf(list, {
- maxResultItems: 10
+ limit: 10
})
```

_Reason for the change: We've found that users of this library and authors of other fuzzy libraries usually use `limit` as the term. This also matches with the term we use in SQL clauses._

### `options.cache`

This option has been removed. Please remove its instances from your code if you've written any.

```diff
const fzf = new Fzf(list, {
- cache: true,
  // ... other options
})
```

_Reason: Caching mechanism which we were using was not too useful in the context of a fuzzy matcher._

### `options.normalize`

`normalize` is now turned on by default. This means that by default, diacritics/accents from words will be removed. (So search string "fe" will match both "Caffè" and "Caffe" for example.) This change should not affect most of the users of this library, but if you are aware of this feature and want to keep it turned off, you'll have to assign it to false.

```diff
const fzf = new Fzf(list, {
+ normalize: false,
  // ... other options
})
```

_Reason: We felt that setting this option on is a sensible default. This is something that [other finders](https://github.com/kentcdodds/match-sorter#keepdiacritics-boolean) have turned on too. However we are aware that few people can have [opinion](https://twitter.com/vanhelbergen/status/1425275180356571140?s=20) [against](https://twitter.com/bk2204/status/1425221716540801026?s=20) it. For fuzzy finders removing diacritics does make sense, but for form fields that are going to be saved it doesn't._

### `options.forward`

This option wasn't available in v0.3.

If you queried "comp" on "src/components/input-composed.ts" you would get:

| v0.3                                    | v0.4                                    |
| ---                                     | ---                                     |
| src/components/input-<b>comp</b>osed.ts | src/<b>comp</b>onents/input-composed.ts |

So in v0.3 "comp" that appears at the end is highlighted while in v0.4 first match from the start is highlighted.

If you want to keep the old behaviour, you would need to turn `forward` off:

```diff
const fzf = new Fzf(list, {
+ forward: false,
  // ... other options
})
```

_Reason: This was mistakenly set other way round in previous version._

### `resultItem.positions`

`positions` has now been converted to a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) and will always be a non-null value. You usually use `positions` to highlight matched characters of a string.

```diff
- <HighlightChars text={entry.item} indices={entry.positions ?? []} />
+ <HighlightChars text={entry.item} indices={entry.positions} />


// ...

interface HighlightCharsProps {
  text: string
- indices: number[]
+ indices: Set<number>
}

// ...

export const HighlightChars = (props: HighlightCharsProps) => {
  const strArr = props.text.split("");
  const nodes = strArr.map((v, i) => {
-   if (props.indices.includes(i)) {
+   if (props.indices.has(i)) {
```

_Reason: We expect it to simplify highlighting logic._

### `resultItem.result`

`result` is flattened. This will result in the following code change:

```diff
const entries = (new Fzf(list)).find(query); 
const entry = entries[0];

- const { start, end, score } = entry.result
+ const { start, end, score } = entry


// Alternatively:
- const start = entry.result.start
- const end = entry.result.end
- const score = entry.result.score
+ const start = entry.start
+ const end = entry.end
+ const score = entry.score
```

_Reason: A nested `result` property introduces confusion while explaining the topics, as this word is also used when we get result from `find` for example. Moreover, this word is too vague in its definition if used alone._
