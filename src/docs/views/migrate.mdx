# Migration Guide

## v0.4 → v0.5

We only have made some changes in `tiebreakers` in this release. FZF doesn't uses this option by default. So if you have not used a tiebreaker in your code, a version bump is all what you need!

### `options.tiebreakers`

- The third argument of tiebreaker has been changed from `options` to `selector`

```diff
- function byTrimmedLengthAsc(a, b, options) {
-   return options.selector(a.item).trim().length - options.selector(b.item).trim().length;
+ function byTrimmedLengthAsc(a, b, selector) {
+   return selector(a.item).trim().length - selector(b.item).trim().length;
  }


const fzf = new Fzf(list, () => {
  tiebreakers: [byTrimmedLengthAsc]
})
```

- The behaviour of tiebreakers now matches with original FZF and with [other search solutions](https://youtu.be/7WQ00Y-80qs?t=3195). You can find more details about it in the updated section for tiebreakers in the docs.

This new behaviour would only affect the result if you've supplied more than one tiebreaker to FZF. If you want to keep the old behaviour, you would need to provide the code from your side to handle it. You would have to change your code from:

```js
const options = {
  limit: 32,
  tiebreakers: [byLengthAsc, byStartAsc]
  // ... other options
}

const fzf = new Fzf(list, options)
const result = fzf.find(query)

// `result` is now ready for you to use
```

To:

```js
const options = {
  // remove `limit` and `tiebreakers` from here
  // ... other options
}

const fzf = new Fzf(list, options)
const result = fzf.find(query)

options['limit'] = 32
options['tiebreakers'] = [byLengthAsc, byStartAsc]

if (options.sort !== false) {
  for (const tiebreaker of options.tiebreakers) {
    result.sort((a, b) => {
      if (a.score === b.score) {
        return tiebreaker(a, b, options.selector ?? v => v);
      }
      return 0;
    });
  }
}

if (Number.isFinite(options.limit)) {
  result.splice(options.limit);
}

// `result` is now ready for you to use
```

## v0.3 → v0.4

### `options.maxResultItems`

`maxResultItems` has been renamed. Please change occurrences of `maxResultItems` to `limit` in your code.

```diff
const fzf = new Fzf(list, {
- maxResultItems: 10
+ limit: 10
})
```

### `options.cache`

This option has been removed. Please remove its instances from your code if you've written any.

```diff
const fzf = new Fzf(list, {
- cache: true,
  // ... other options
})
```

### `options.normalize`

`normalize` is now turned on by default. This means that by default, diacritics/accents from words will be removed. (So search string "fe" will match both "Caffè" and "Caffe" for example.) This change should not affect most of the users of this library, but if you are aware of this feature and want to keep it turned off, you'll have to assign it to false.

```diff
const fzf = new Fzf(list, {
+ normalize: false,
  // ... other options
})
```

### `options.forward`

This option wasn't available in v0.3.

If you queried "comp" on "src/components/input-composed.ts" you would get:

| v0.3                                    | v0.4                                    |
| ---                                     | ---                                     |
| src/components/input-<b>comp</b>osed.ts | src/<b>comp</b>onents/input-composed.ts |

So in v0.3 "comp" that appears at the end is highlighted while in v0.4 first match from the start is highlighted.

If you want to keep the old behaviour, you would need to turn `forward` off:

```diff
const fzf = new Fzf(list, {
+ forward: false,
  // ... other options
})
```

### `resultItem.positions`

`positions` has now been converted to a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) and will always be a non-null value. You usually use `positions` to highlight matched characters of a string.

```diff
- <HighlightChars text={entry.item} indices={entry.positions ?? []} />
+ <HighlightChars text={entry.item} indices={entry.positions} />


// ...

interface HighlightCharsProps {
  text: string
- indices: number[]
+ indices: Set<number>
}

// ...

export const HighlightChars = (props: HighlightCharsProps) => {
  const strArr = props.text.split("");
  const nodes = strArr.map((v, i) => {
-   if (props.indices.includes(i)) {
+   if (props.indices.has(i)) {
```

### `resultItem.result`

`result` is flattened. This will result in the following code change:

```diff
const entries = (new Fzf(list)).find(query); 
const entry = entries[0];

- const { start, end, score } = entry.result
+ const { start, end, score } = entry
```
